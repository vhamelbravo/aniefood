## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

It was important to make the website as responsive as possible, despite having two complicated elements (Those being the search bar and the interactive menu), so i needed to really take focus on how to optimize the site as much as possible, i managed to shorten my bloated JavaScript code to as few lines as possible, making it much faster and more functional.
## Lessons Learned:

This was my first time working with JavaScript on a real project, so starting from having an extremely limited knowledge about the language, i managed to quickly achieve what i wanted to do through my own research, i remained calm, and even though the task looked impossible i managed to accomplish it inside the time span.
